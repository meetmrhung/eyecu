+ change offsheet connectors to netlists
+ lower curent through amber LEDs
+ look for a better way to route camera
+ modify cam rst?
+ label all pins for connector to beagle
+ add 0 ohm Rs to power lines
+ move line regs to camera board?
+ can put components under the XBee
+ ask Arielle for circuitry she wants to use with the camera
+ fets to be able to turn off and on 1.5 and 2.8 lines
+ smaller headers and cable for camera board? Check what Samtec can do
+ perhaps look for a different level shifter that is more suitable?
+ what should we do with vsync and hsync?
+ change oscillator to the same that Rapid Fire used
+ change line regs to what Rapid Fire used (having trouble with the 2.8V reg)

Relayout:
	Move level shifter + fets to camera board
	Widen headers by 1 row (P1 and P2 are too close together)
	Make header holes slightly larger
	XBee header holes ? larger. Currently dip package, change to full size?
	Check footprint for oscillator driver
	Fix footprint for crystal
	Check footprints for tlv1117s
	Fix grounds on level shifter
	Change LEDs from blue to… something else
	VDD_5V doesn’t supply power? SYS_5V does
	Ground /OE for level shifter
	Add switch to turn on voltages for camera
